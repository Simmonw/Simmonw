- Hi, I’m @Simmonw and welcome to my page I'm super excited that you decided to visit!
- I’m interested in all things that have to do with Data, more specificallly Data Science and Machine Learning.
- Right now I'm finishing up my SQL learning and taking on Python then I'm going to learn R next so if you're an expert in any of these spaces please reach out!
- I'm currently looking to use my page as a way to help get my first Data Scientist role and will be displaying my work and my progress as I continue to grow.
- I’m looking to collaborate on as many Data projects as possible. Anything that I can do assist anyone and develop my skills in the space I'm completely open.
- I can't wait to dive deep into this community!
